First, the dataset folder containing images and ground truth disparity maps should be in the same directory as our jupyter notebook.

At the beginning of the jupyter notebook, is the part that reads the data, which should be run sequentially. Then there is the disparity map algorithm we implemented for block matching and the code for calculating the errors.

After this we make improvements to the basic block matching algorithm and test its performance. 

Finally, we summarize the results and present them. This part should be run after all the previous code has been run
